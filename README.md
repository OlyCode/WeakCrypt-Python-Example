WeakCrypt Python Example is a simple program that demonstrates 
encryption using an iterated SHA256 hash as a stream cypher. 
WeakCrypt's diminutive title refers to the fact that cryptography 
is easy to do wrong. Using a secure hash algorithm as a stream 
cypher is not necessarily a cryptographically secure technique.
